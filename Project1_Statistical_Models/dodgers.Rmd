# Introduction

The Dodgers is a professional baseball team and plays in the Major Baseball League. The team owns a 56,000-seat stadium and is interested in increasing the attendance of their fans during home games.*At the moment the team management would like to know if bobblehead promotions increase the attendance of the team's fans?* This is a case study based on @miller2014modeling[Chapter 2].

```{r, out.width=c("33%","33%","13%"), fig.align='center', fig.show="hold", fig.cap="56,000-seat Dodgers (left), stadium  (middle), shirts and caps  (right) *bobblehead*"}
include_graphics(c("los_angeles-dodgers-stadium.jpg",
                 "Los-Angeles-Dodgers-Promo.jpg",
                 "adrian_bobble.jpg"))
```

    
The 2012 season data in the `events` table of SQLite database `data/dodgers.sqlite` contain for each of  81 home play the 

* month, 
* day, 
* weekday, 
* part of the day (day or night),
* attendance, 
* opponent, 
* temperature, 
* whether cap or shirt or bobblehead promotions were run, and 
* whether fireworks were present.

# Prerequisites

We will use `R`, `RStudio`, `R Markdown` for the next three weeks to fit statistical models to various data and analyze them. Read @wickham2017r online

*  [Section 1.1](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/introduction.html#prerequisites) for how to download and install `R` and `RStudio`,
* [Chapter 27](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/r-markdown.html) for how to use `R Markdown` to interact with `R` and conduct various predictive analyses.

All materials for the next three weeks will be available on [Google drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1LhcwLJOgqsvcK3p39yOm6jelmfs6G1gf).

# Exploratory data analysis

@. Connect to  `data/dodgers.sqlite`. Read table `events` into a variable in `R`.

    * Read @baumer2017modern[Chapters 1, 4, 5, 12] for getting data from and writing them to various SQL databases. 
    * Because we do not want to hassle with user permissions, we will use SQLite for practice. I recommend `PostgreSQL` for real projects.
    
    * Open `RStudio` terminal, connect to database `dodgers.sqlite` with `sqlite3`. Explore it (there is only one table, `events`, at this time) with commands 
      - `.help`
      - `.databases `
      - `.tables`
      - `.schema <table_name>`
      - `.headers on`
      - `.mode column`
      - `SELECT ...`
      - `.quit`
      
    * Databases are great to store and retrieve large data, especially, when they are indexed with respect to variables/columns along with we do search and match extensively. 
    * `R` (likewise, `Python`) allows one to seeminglessly read from and write to databases. For fast analysis, keep data in a database, index tables for fast retrieval, use `R` or `Python` to fit models to data.

library(RSQLite)
con <- dbConnect(SQLite(), "C:/dodgers.sqlite")

# dbListTables(con) 

# this will let sqlite do all jobs for us
events <-  tbl(con, "events")

# pipes (%>%) below allow us to run chains of commands without having to
# creating temporary variables in between (R does that automatically 
# for us)
events %>% 
  select(month, day, day_of_week, opponent, bobblehead, attend) %>%

  collect() %>% 
  pander(caption = "A glimpse (first six rows and columns) of data retrieved from events table of database")

# Next command copies the entire data to the memory of local machine. Do not do
# this if the table is large

d <- dbReadTable(con, "events")
```
</center>

@. What are the number of plays on each week day and in each month of a year?
<center>
    ```{r}
# after class. Check the Rmd file for work done in class. Here I write the streamlined version addressing the question.
d %>% 
  mutate(day_of_week = factor(day_of_week, levels = c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday"))) %>% 
  count(day_of_week, name = "Number of games") %>% 
  rename(`Week day`= day_of_week) %>% 
  pander(caption = "Number of games on week days")
```
</center>
    The games were played pretty much uniformly across each week day except Thursday, which has less than half of the games than other days.
<center>
    ```{r}
d %>% 
  mutate(month = factor(month, levels = c("APR", "MAY", "JUN", "JUL", "AUG", "SEP", "OCT"))) %>% 
  count(month, name = "Number of games") %>% 
  rename(`Month`= month) %>% 
  pander(caption = "Number of games across months")
```
</center>
May hosted the greatest number of games, while October the least. June has as much as the half of games in May. The remainder months have high and similar game numbers.

    ```{r, eval=FALSE}
# in class
d %>% dim() %>% `[` (1)
dim(d)[1]

d %>% dim()

d %>% count(day_of_week, sort=TRUE)
d %>% count(day_of_week, day_night, name = "cnt", sort=TRUE) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = day_night, values_from = cnt)

d %>% count(day_of_week, bobblehead, name = "cnt", sort=TRUE) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = bobblehead, values_from = cnt)

d %>% 
  group_by(day_of_week) %>% 
  summarize(mean = mean(attend)) %>% 
  arrange(mean) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(day_of_week, mean)) +
  geom_point()

d %>% 
  count(month, sort=TRUE)
```

@. Check the orders of the levels of the `day_of_week` and `month` factors. If necessary, put them in the logical order.
<center>
    ```{r}
d2 <- d %>% 
  mutate(day_of_week = factor(day_of_week, levels = c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday")),
         month = factor(month, levels = c("APR", "MAY", "JUN", "JUL", "AUG", "SEP", "OCT")))
d2 %>% 
  select(day_of_week, month) %>% 
  summary() %>% 
  pander(caption = "Month and week day names now follow time order.")
```
</center>
    
@. How many times were bobblehead promotions run on each week day?

    ```{r}
d2 %>% 
  count(day_of_week, bobblehead, name = "cnt") %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = bobblehead, values_from = cnt) %>% 
  rename(`Weekday` = day_of_week) %>% 
  kable(format = kable_format, caption = "Number of times booblehead was given away on games played different weekdays", booktabs=TRUE) %>% 
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE) %>% 
  add_header_above(c(" "=1, "Bobblehead"=2))
```

    Bobbleheads were given away in total 11 out of 81 games. Eight of bobbleheads were given during the weekdays, Tuesday and Thursdays Thuesday takes the leads with more than half of all bobbleheads given during season.

@. How did the attendance vary across week days? Draw boxplots. On which day of week was the attendance the highest on average?

    ```{r}
d2 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(day_of_week, attend, group=1)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_y_continuous(labels=scales::comma) +
  geom_smooth(se=FALSE, method="loess")
```

     Figure shows 81 game attendance numbers with a loess smoother. The average attendance stays pretty much constant a little above 40,000. Only five games were played on Thursdays, so it is hard to say that attendance on Thursday games are  decisively lower than average. However, Monday has more data and games on Monday  tended to attract lower fans in the stadium.

@. Is there an association between attendance and 
    - whether the game is played in day light or night? 
    - Between attendance and whether skies are clear or cloudy?  
  
(ref:capboxplots) Attendance distributions across games played in day light and at night are displayed on the left. Medians are close, and mid 50% coincide. Game time does not seem to be marginally important. On the right, the median attendances for games played under clear and cloudy skies look different, but the difference does not seem significant when the variations of mid 50% attendance numbers are taken into account. Those variations can reduce and difference can stick out after we take other explanatory variables into account.  
  
    Draw separate boxplots and comment on the plots.
```{r, fig.cap="(ref:capboxplots)", out.width="49%", fig.show="hold"}

d2 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(day_night, attend)) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(fill=day_night)) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")

d2 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(skies, attend)) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(fill=skies)) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

    We can run a formaly Chi-suared test of independence.
```{r}
skies_tbl <- d2 %>% 
      mutate(attend_cut = cut(attend, breaks = c(0, quantile(attend, prob=(1:2)/3), Inf))) %>% 
      xtabs(~ attend_cut + skies, .) 
    
skies_tbl %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from=skies, values_from = n) %>% 
  kable(caption = "Note that more than half of the games played under cloudy skies have attendance on the lower side, whereas only less than one third of the games played under clear skies are on the lower side.", booktabs = TRUE) %>% 
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE) %>% 
  add_header_above(c(" "= 1, "skies" = 2))
```

<center>
```{r}

chisq.test(skies_tbl) %>%   pander()

```
</center>  
  
   Chi-square test has a marginal 7% p-value, under which we cannot reject independence of attendance and skies, but its small value calls for a more comprehensive analysis together with other values.
  

@. Is there an association between attendance and temperature? 
    - If yes, is there a positive or negative association? 
    - Do the associations differ on clear and cloud days or day or night times? 
    
    Draw scatterplots and comment.

    ```{r, fig.cap="The smoother makes clear that uncomfortably low and high temperatures discourage fans from attending game in the stadium. "}
d2 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(temp, attend)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(se=FALSE, method="loess")
```


\clearpage
# A linear regression model

Regress attendance on month, day of the week, and bobblehead promotion.

$$
\text{attendance}_i  = \beta_0 + \beta_{MAY} \delta_{MA, i} + \ldots + \beta_{OCT} \delta_{OCT, i} + \beta_{Tue}\delta_{Tue, i} + \ldots + \beta_{Sun}\delta_{Sun, i} + \beta_{YES} \delta_{YES, i} + \varepsilon_i.
$$
for $i =1,\ldots, 81,$ where $\varepsilon_i \sim \text{Normal}(0, \sigma^2)$, and the $\delta$ are dummy variables, one if the associated event occurs for the $i$th game, and zero otherwise.
$$
\begin{aligned}
\beta_0 &:\text{average attendance for a typical game played on some Monday in APR when no bobblehead was NOT given away,}\\
\beta_{MAY}&: \text{average difference in attendance for a typical game played in MAY rather than APR,}\\
\beta_{Tue}&: \text{average difference in attendance for a typical game played on Tuesday rather than Monday,}\\
\beta_{YES}&: \text{average difference in attendance for a typical game when a bobblehead is given away.}
\end{aligned}
$$
and other betas are defined similarly.

We find the $\beta$ with maximum likelihood:
```{r, comment=""}
lmod <- lm(attend ~ month + day_of_week + bobblehead, d2)
lmod
# lmod %>% pander(caption = "Linear regression model")
```

* We expect `r scales::comma(coef(lmod)["(Intercept)"])` attendance on a game played on some Monday in APR and no bobblehead was given. 
* If, instead, game is played on MAY, the attendance is expected to drop by `r scales::comma(abs(coef(lmod)["monthMAY"]))`. 
* If a bobblehead is given away, then we expect attendance to increase by `r scales::comma(abs(coef(lmod)["bobbleheadYES"]))`. 

The bobblehead seems to increase the attendance number by a larger quantity than any other factor. However, is the difference statistically significant? We will test it below.

@. Is there any evidence for a relationship between attendance and other variables? Why or why not?

```{r, comment=""}
small <- update(lmod, . ~ 1 )
anova(small, lmod)
```

Test $H_0: \beta_{MAY} = \ldots = \beta_{OCT} = \beta_{Tue} = \ldots = \beta_{Sun} = \beta_{YES} = 0$

We reject small/null model because F stat is large (or p-value is small <= 0.05). We conclude that at least one of variables on thr right has some reltion to attendance.

    
@. Does the bobblehead promotion have a statistically significant effect on the attendance?
    
Test $H_0: \beta_{YES} = 0$.    
    
```{r, comment=""}
small <-  update(lmod, . ~ . - bobblehead)
anova(small, lmod)
```
    Since p-value is practically zero, we reject the small model, which means that bobblehead is important in explaing the increase in attendance.
    
@. Do month and day of week variables help to explain the number of attendants?

Similarly, we will conduct F tests.
```{r, comment=""}
drop1(lmod, test="F")
```
All explanatory variables are needed in the model to get a good accuracy on future predictions (AIC) and to explain variation in the existing attendance data (F-test). So we stick to full model.

$$
AIC  = -2 \times \text{log-likelihood} + 2\times\text{number of parameters in the model}
$$

@. How many fans are expected to be drawn **alone by a bobblehead promotion** to a home game? Give a 90\% confidence interval.

The expected additional number of attendance is $\beta_{YES}$, which is estimated as `r scales::comma(coef(lmod)["bobbleheadYES"])`.

```{r, comment=""}
confint(lmod, level = 0.90)["bobbleheadYES",]
```
    
@. How good does the model fit to the data? Why? Comment on residual standard error and R$^2$. Plot observed attendance against predicted attendance. 

R2 is the fraction of variation in attendance (in the past 81 games) explained by the current (month, day_of_week, bobblehead). Here, R2 becomes `r round(100*summary(lmod)$r.squared)`% of variation explained. Our model is not too bad, but not too good either.

The standard deviation of error is `r scales::comma(summary(lmod)$sigma)`, which is `r round(100*summary(lmod)$sigma/mean(d2$attend))`% of average attendance we expect. Compared to 40% typical error percentage, this is not bad.
    
@. Predict the number of attendees to a typical home game on a **Wednesday** in **June** if a **bobblehead promotion** is extended. Give a 90% prediction interval.

```{r, comment=""}
d2$month %>% levels()
d2$day_of_week %>%  levels()
d2$bobblehead %>%  unique()

newdata <- data.frame(month = "JUN", day_of_week = "Wednesday",
                      bobblehead = "YES")
predict(lmod, newdata=newdata, level=0.90, 
        interval = "prediction")

# ?predict.lm
```

# More ideas about improving our model

## Introduce new variables. 

Let us check if `opponent` variable should be added to the model.

```{r}
broom::augment(lmod, data=d2) %>% 
  mutate(opponent = factor(opponent)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(reorder(opponent, .std.resid), .std.resid)) +
  geom_hline(yintercept=0, col="white", size=2) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  coord_flip() 
```
Because we are consistently under- and over-estimating attendance in games played against certain opponents, it is a good idea to add. opponent.

##  Introduce interaction between existing variables

It is natural to expect interaction between month and day_of_week: during summer months, people are expected to spend more time outdoors, especially, during weekends. Let us see if data are consistent with current no-interaction model estimates.

```{r, fig.asp=2}
d3 <- mutate(d2, bobblehead = factor(bobblehead))
lmod <- update(lmod, data  = d3)

effects::effect(c("month","day_of_week"), lmod,
                partial.residuals = TRUE ) %>% plot(layout = c(1,7))
```

Model seems to overestimate effects of Wednesday and Thursday in APR and MAY and underestimate Tursday effects in AUG and SEP. Let us augment model with interaction term and run an F-test to check if it is statistically significant.

### Model selection with F-test

```{r, comment=""}
lmod
large <- update(lmod, . ~ . + month:day_of_week)
anova(lmod, large)
```

P-value is large, so we cannot reject small model. Therefore, F-test concluded that interaction between month and day_of_week is unimportant.

### Model selection with AIC

```{r, comment=""}
 final <- update(lmod, . ~ .^2) %>%  step()
```

Step() applies repeatedly drop1 to find the model with the least AIC until no new term is found to drop out of last model. So interaction terms other than month:day_of_week turn out be unimportant from prediction accuracy on unseen data as estimated by AIC.

### Model selection with cross-validation and t-test

Check if the interaction term is necessary  with **cross-validation**

```{r, fig.cap="Comparison of models without and with interaction term", comment=""}

set.seed(461)

nfolds <- 5
folds <- rep(seq(5), nrow(d2), len=nrow(d2)) %>% sample()
rmse_lmod <- rep(NA, nfolds)
rmse_lmod_interaction <- rep(NA, nfolds)

lmod_interaction <- update(lmod, . ~ . + month:day_of_week)

for (i in seq(nfolds)){
  train <- d2[folds!=i,]
  test <- d2[folds==i,]
  
  # train lm without interaction model
  lmod_train <- update(lmod, data = train)
  lmod_test <- predict(lmod_train, newdata = test)
  rmse_lmod[i] <- (test$attend - lmod_test)^2 %>% mean() %>% sqrt()
  
  # train lm with interaction model
  lmod_interaction_train <- update(lmod_interaction, data = train)
  lmod_interaction_test <- suppressWarnings(predict(lmod_interaction_train, newdata = test))
  rmse_lmod_interaction[i] <- (test$attend - lmod_interaction_test)^2 %>% mean() %>% sqrt()
}

cv <- tibble(lmod = rmse_lmod, lmod_interaction = rmse_lmod_interaction) %>% 
  mutate(dif_rmse = lmod - lmod_interaction)

cv %>% 
  apply(2,mean)

p1 <- cv %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols=c(lmod, lmod_interaction), names_to = "model", values_to = "rmse") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(model, rmse)) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(fill=model)) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")

p2 <- cv %>% 
  ggplot(aes(1, dif_rmse)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(y = "Differences between rmse values on different folds\nof models without and with interaction terms", x=NULL) + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(), axis.ticks.x = element_blank())

gridExtra::grid.arrange(p1,p2,layout_matrix = matrix(c(1,1,2), nrow=1))
```

Run a **two-sided t-test** on the difference of rmse values to check if the mean rmse values for models with and without interaction terms are the same.

```{r, comment=""}
t.test(x = cv$dif_rmse)
```

Because p-value is small, we conclude that the models have different mean rmse values. Because the t statistic is negative, model without interaction term seems to have a lower rmse than the model with interaction term.
